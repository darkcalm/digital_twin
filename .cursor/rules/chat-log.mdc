# Chat Log Format Rules

## Purpose
This document defines the format and rules for exporting chat logs in the digital twin project.

## Format Requirements

### Basic Structure
- Each chat log should be saved as a markdown file with `.log` extension
- File should be placed in the `chats` directory
- Filename should follow the pattern `session-{number}.log`

### Content Requirements
1. Header
   - Start with a title indicating the session number and main topic
   - Example: `# Session {number}: {Main Topic}`

2. Message Format
   - Each message should be clearly labeled as either "User:" or "Assistant:"
   - Messages should be preserved in chronological order
   - Include the complete conversation, word by word
   - Preserve all code blocks, file paths, and technical details

3. Tool Calls
   - Include tool calls and their results when relevant to the conversation
   - Skip detailed runtime output (e.g., terminal responses) unless specifically relevant
   - Format tool calls as code blocks with appropriate language tags

4. File References
   - Preserve all file references using the @ symbol
   - Include full file paths when referenced

5. Code Changes
   - Include all code changes discussed
   - Format code blocks with appropriate language tags
   - Preserve file paths and line numbers when relevant

### Example Format
```markdown
# Session {number}: {Main Topic}

## Initial Request
User: [Complete user message]

## Assistant Response
[Complete assistant response including any tool calls]

## User Response
[Complete user message]

## Assistant Response
[Complete assistant response including any tool calls]

[Continue with full conversation...]
```

## Guidelines
1. Do not summarize or condense the conversation
2. Preserve all technical details and context
3. Include all file references and code changes
4. Skip only non-essential runtime details
5. Maintain chronological order of the conversation
6. Use clear section headers to separate different parts of the conversation

## Notes
- If timestamps are not available, focus on maintaining the chronological order
- Ensure all code blocks are properly formatted with language tags
- Preserve all file paths and references using the @ symbol
- Include all tool calls and their results when relevant to the conversation flow
