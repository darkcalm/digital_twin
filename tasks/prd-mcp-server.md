# Product Requirements Document: MCP Server for Digital Twin Simulation

## Introduction/Overview
This feature implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes tools and data for a digital twin simulation system. The system consists of two main entities: a solar power plant and a survey robot. The MCP server will provide an interface for these entities to interact with each other and with external systems.

## Goals
1. Create an MCP server that exposes the plant's setpoint control and state monitoring capabilities
2. Implement a survey robot simulation that can interact with the plant
3. Enable persistent storage of plant state data through the robot's actions
4. Maintain the existing solar power plant simulation logic

## User Stories
1. As a system operator, I want to set the plant's setpoint through the MCP server so that I can control the power output
2. As a system operator, I want to monitor the plant's state through the MCP server so that I can track its performance
3. As a system operator, I want the survey robot to store plant state data persistently so that I can analyze historical performance

## Functional Requirements
1. The MCP server must expose a tool called `set_plant_setpoint` that accepts a float parameter between 0 and 1
2. The MCP server must expose a data resource called `get_plant_state` that returns the current state of the plant
3. The MCP server must initialize both the plant and robot simulations on startup
4. The robot simulation must include a store action for persisting plant state data
5. The plant simulation must maintain its existing logic for calculating power output based on irradiation and setpoint
6. The MCP server must handle concurrent requests from multiple clients

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Implementation of error handling and edge cases (to be addressed in a future phase)
2. Performance optimization and benchmarking (to be addressed in a future phase)
3. Implementation of additional plant or robot capabilities
4. User interface development
5. Authentication and authorization mechanisms

## Design Considerations
1. The MCP server should follow the Model Context Protocol specification
2. The server should maintain separation of concerns between plant and robot simulations
3. The robot's store action should use a simple file-based storage system for this phase
4. The server should maintain the existing API structure for plant state and setpoint control

## Technical Considerations
1. The implementation will use the official MCP Python SDK
2. The server will maintain compatibility with the existing FastAPI implementation
3. The robot simulation will be implemented as a separate module
4. The plant state data structure will remain unchanged from the current implementation

## Success Metrics
1. Successful integration of the MCP server with the existing simulation system
2. Ability to set plant setpoints and retrieve plant state through the MCP interface
3. Successful implementation of the robot's store action for plant state data
4. Maintained functionality of the existing plant simulation

## Open Questions
1. What is the preferred format for storing plant state data?
2. Should the robot simulation have any additional capabilities beyond storing plant state?
3. What is the desired frequency of plant state data storage?
4. Should there be any limits on the frequency of setpoint changes?
